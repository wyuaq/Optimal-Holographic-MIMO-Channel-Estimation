# Optimal-Holographic-MIMO-Channel-Estimation
Pytorch codes for "Bayes-Optimal Unsupervised Learning for Channel Estimation in Near-Field Holographic MIMO" in IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing (JSTSP), to appear, 2024.

**Note: I am currently organizing the code and will release it by the end of June at the latest.**

## Introduction

This repository contains the codes of the Bayes-optimal score-based channel estimation algorithm proposed in our [journal paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10438) "**Bayes-Optimal Unsupervised Learning for Channel Estimation in Near-Field Holographic MIMO**", which was accepted by the **IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing (JSTSP)**, Special Issue on Near-Field Signal Processing, Jun. 2024. 

A preliminary [conference paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07908) "**Learning Bayes-Optimal Channel Estimation for Holographic MIMO in Unknown EM Environments**", was presented before at the 2024 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC'24), Denver, CO, USA.

The notations used in the codes may be slightly different from those in the papers. I tried to clarify with detailed comments. Should you meet any confusion or need any further help, please feel free to contact me via email (my github name [at] connect.ust.hk).

If you find the codes useful for your research, please kindly cite our journal paper (bibtex file is provided at the bottom). 

Enjoy reproducible research!
