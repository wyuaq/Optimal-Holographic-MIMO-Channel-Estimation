# Optimal-Holographic-MIMO-Channel-Estimation

**Note: I am currently organizing the code and adding more comments, and will release it by the end of June.**

## Introduction

This repository contains the codes of the Bayes-optimal unsupervised channel estimation algorithm proposed in our [journal paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10438) "**Bayes-Optimal Unsupervised Learning for Channel Estimation in Near-Field Holographic MIMO**", which was accepted by the **IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing (JSTSP)**, Special Issue on Near-Field Signal Processing, to appear, Jun. 2024. 

A preliminary [conference paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07908) "Learning Bayes-Optimal Channel Estimation for Holographic MIMO in Unknown EM Environments", was presented before at the 2024 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC'24), Denver, CO, USA.

The notations used in the codes may be slightly different from those in the papers. I tried to clarify with detailed comments. Should you meet any confusion or need any further help, please feel free to contact me via email (my github name [at] connect.ust.hk).

If you find the codes useful for your research, please kindly cite our journal paper (bibtex file is provided at the bottom). Enjoy reproducible research!
